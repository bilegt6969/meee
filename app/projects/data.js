            description: `Shaft 2, the most important underground development facility for the Oyu Tolgoi project, has been successfully completed and handed over. Dayan Contract Mining LLC successfully completed the construction of the Shaft-2, the world's largest and latest underground mine shaft.
            Once Shaft 2 is fully commissioned, it will be the main access to the Oyu Tolgoi underground mine. The shaft will be used for transporting up to 300 people per cage, the movement of equipment and materials. The headframe, at a height of 96m, houses the 10m diameter, 1284m deep shaft. The entire shaft construction – from sinking through to equipping (roughly 3000 tons of steel) – has taken 3 years 4 months to complete. 
            Shaft 2 production and service hoists are the largest Koepe (friction) hoists in the world employing approximately 32 kilometers (270 tons) of steel ropes. The entire 24 rope installation process required 25 days by a team of approximately 300 employees. 
            This achievement is one of the safest, most technically challenging, and efficient rope-ups undertaken anywhere in the world.`,
